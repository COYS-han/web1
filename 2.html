  The message from Mauricio Pochettino was ‘we’re so close’ after FA Cup heartbreak against United on Saturday.
  We started so well at Wembley and took the lead on 11 minutes when Dele Alli swept home Christian Eriksen’s cross. Further chances followed in this purple patch as Harry Kane just failed to connect in front of goal and Christian fired just wide.
  United levelled with a goal out of nothing from Alexis Sanchez on 24 minutes but we continued to push and Eric Dier struck the post just before half-time.
  The second half was more even and United got ahead through Ander Herrera on 62 minutes. After that, United strangled the game, it became bitty, scrappy and despite dominating possession and pushing for an equaliser, we couldn’t carve out a clear-cut chance as it stayed 2-1.
  "We competed really well, started the game really well and 1-1 at half-time was completely unfair,” said Mauricio. “We created more and played better.
  “The second half was even, we conceded and when you face this type of team, with the quality they have, it's always on the limit, everything is difficult. They played so deep and were good in all of the transitions.
  “I'm happy with the effort and the performance - nothing more to say, nothing to regret, we're so close and we need to keep pushing until the end of the season.
  “We need to be sure to play in the Champions League next season.”
