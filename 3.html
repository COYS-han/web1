  Sean Davis was back in a Spurs shirt for the first time in 12 years on Sunday as he made his debut for the Legends team – and he was quick to praise the “huge progress” the club has been making under Mauricio Pochettino.
  It doesn’t seem that long ago that the midfielder joined us from Fulham ahead of the 2004-05 season and started our first four Premier League games as we opened strongly with two wins and two draws.
  A skilful player capable of making powerful runs forward, he would make 17 appearances over the next 18 months before leaving for Portsmouth in January, 2006, without truly fulfilling his potential due to injuries.
  Now 38 years of age and retired as a player since 2012 following a loan spell at Bristol City from Bolton Wanderers, Sean resurfaced with a 90-minute stint in the sunshine as the Legends battled Hastings United Vets in front of almost 2,500 fans down on the East Sussex coast and, while admitting to having mixed emotions over his own time at the club, was full of praise for our present-day stars.
  “Spurs have made huge progress,” said the Clapham-born grafter. “On their day they can beat anyone in the Premier League and they’ve got the right man in Mauricio Pochettino.
  “I think they’ve got top players in all positions. Centre-midfield is quite strong – I’m loving Eriksen, I think he’s unbelievable and he doesn’t get as much praise as he should. I don’t know what the stats are but the amount of goals he creates must be crazy.
  “Dier is a solid player who can play centre-half as well and I’m a massive fan of Dembele, who was obviously at Fulham too. I don’t think he realises how good he is.”
